Can't we compile the package with "scram b" along with other CMSSW packages? (TJ)
We really don't use master branch? In principle, we should develop on the master branch and then make a branch when it is necessary. 
At some point, we will have 6X which would be much different from 5X. Then we make another branch from the 53X branch? (TJ)
